# Instructions
You work for a philanthropy and you are helping to build a Donor Management System to track their fundraising.


# Relationships
There are many different campaigns. A campaign has many donors and a donor has many campaigns.

Set up the tables with the following information:
A campaign has a name, a start date and a tagline
A donor has a name
A campaign-donor table joins them

Test if your relationships are properly working by using the seed data included.

# Deliverables
Your sprint is to build out the campaign functionality (all CRUD actions/views for a campaign). You should be able to add donors to a campaign via the campaign edit page.

Try adding a few validations.
