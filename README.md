# Instructions

You work for a fundraising consultancy that helps different companies in their fundraising efforts. In order to track the success of your work, you are building a Donor Management System. Your system tracks:
- companies
- campaigns
- donors

# Relationships
A company runs many campaigns, but the campaign is specific to that company. A campaign has many donors, but donors might donate to a lot of campaigns at a lot of companies.

Set up the tables with the following information:
A company has a name and a motto.
A campaign has a name and a start date
A donor has a name
Make sure to include your relationships in there!

Test if your relationships are properly working by using the seed data included.
